In the project, an example of digital information transfer was created by applying digital signage method. Digital signage method is a closed-circuit broadcasting system that provides broadcast streaming by transmitting digital content files from a central point to the screens on the end points over the computer network. These devices are controlled by wired or wireless remote access methods, wireless control is used in the designed announcement screen. Interactive age detection application has been added to the developed announcement screen with an innovative approach. Age detection application was developed by using deep learning method, which is a sub-branch of machine learning, and 79% accuracy was achieved.
